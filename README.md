## Introduction

This repository contains an example of a lens selector. A lens selector provides a list of lens names, and also provides the lenses to the focusing manager.


---
## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Create the following resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-yaml/001_lens-selector-example-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-yaml/002_lens-selector-example-deployment.yaml
```

In order to be discovered by the focusing manager, the service.yaml needs to include the following selector in the `spec` field:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    eu.gravitate-health.fosps.focusing: "true"
```


---
## Usage

Service will be accessible internally from the kubernetes cluster with the url `http://lens-selector-mvp2.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/focus`

---
## Avaible Lenses

The lenses are based on the following definition
